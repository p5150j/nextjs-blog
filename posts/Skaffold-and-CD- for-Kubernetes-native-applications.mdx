Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster.

### Lets begin

```js
brew install skaffold 
```

Youll need to make sure you have Docker installed
docker image
and have Kube setup Dcoker Desktop>Settings>Kube>Enable 

Then install kubectl
```js
brew install kubectl
```
verify 
```js
kubectl version --client
```

Now lets get minikube

```js
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-arm64
sudo install minikube-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```
test and make sure
```js
minikube start
```

Cool nmow we can get back to skaffold

```js
minikube start --profile custom
```
```js
skaffold config set --global local-cluster true
```

```js
eval $(minikube -p custom docker-env)
```

Google has a quick sample app you can use 
```js
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold
cd skaffold/examples/getting-started
```


Its just a simople Go app
```js
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	for {
		fmt.Println("Hello world!")

		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	}
}
```
Then just run 

```js
skaffold dev
```

Then just change the Go app and save it
```js
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)


func main() {
    for {
        fmt.Println("Hello Skaffold!")
        time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
    }
}
```

and you will see the comtainer apply the changes!!
